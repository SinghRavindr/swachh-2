# ♻️ Swachh Saathi

The platform reduces confusion faced by citizens when dealing with municipal problems by providing clear categorization, priority identification, and guidance.

## 📘 Introduction

Urban cities like Delhi face frequent civic challenges related to waste management, sanitation, water supply, air quality, transportation, and energy infrastructure. While citizens are directly affected, they often do not know the correct authority to approach or the steps required to resolve these problems.

Swachh Saathi bridges this gap by offering a single interface where users can describe an issue in natural language and receive relevant information and guidance. The application prioritizes **usability, clarity, and accessibility** over unnecessary complexity.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Delhi residents encounter multiple sustainability-related issues daily. Reporting these problems is difficult due to fragmented systems, lack of clarity about responsibilities, and absence of proper feedback mechanisms. As a result, issues remain unresolved or are reported repeatedly without coordination.

Swachh Saathi streamlines this process by organizing citizen complaints, identifying issue types, and highlighting priority areas that require immediate attention.
